🖐️ I’m an aspiring software engineer with a background in eCommerce, QA, Application Delivery Management, Project Management and Trade Marketing. I have a bachelor’s degree in Economics and Business Management and now I’m studing to become a web developer through an online coding bootcamp called Practicum by Yandex. I’m a curious person, I love to read technical documentation and I like to experiment with new technologies. Now coding is my passion and my new professional career focus. My experience gives me a solid foundation of problem solving and agile skills. My objective is to become a professional developer in the next 3 years.

📚 Focusing on expanding my knowledge of React ❤️

💼 Currently working on:
A simple React application where users could customise their profiles, share their photos, and like others. ➡️ (https://github.com/timothyrusso/around-react)
