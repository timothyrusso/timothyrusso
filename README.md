🖐️ I'm a Frontend Engineer with a background in eCommerce, Quality Assurance, Application Delivery, Project Management, and Trade Marketing. Holding a bachelor's degree in Economics and Business Management, I have also completed the Practicum online coding bootcamp for software development. As a curious individual, I'm passionate about coding and enjoy experimenting with new technologies, which has helped me build a strong foundation in problem-solving and Agile methodologies.

✈️ I love traveling and collaborating with people from around the world.

📚 Currently focusing on expanding my expertise in React, Redux, and TypeScript.
